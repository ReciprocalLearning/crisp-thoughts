# Thoughts When Dealing with Regions, Availability Zones, and Supported Services or Resources

This document outlines a practical workflow for determining Azure region capabilities, availability zone support, and resource deployment options.

## 1. Check Region Support for Availability Zones

- Use the official Azure documentation to verify if a region supports availability zones.
- Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-list

## 2. Identify Product Support by Region

- Use the product availability table to determine which services are supported in a specific region.
- Reference: [Products by Region Table](https://azure.microsoftnfrastructure/products-by-region/table

## 3. Determine Resource Deployment Across Zones

Ask:
- Can this service be deployed in multiple availability zones?
- Is it available in all zones?
- Does it only support regional deployment?

Possible answers:
- Service can be deployed in 2 availability zones.
- Service is available in all zones.
- Service only supports regional deployment (for now).

> **Note:** Availability zone support is rolled out gradually for services.

## 4. Confirm SKU Availability Using Azure CLI

Use these commands to check SKU availability and restrictions:

**List SKUs with restrictions:**

az vm list-skus --location centralus --resource-type virtualMachines --output table --query "[?family=='standardDPSv5Family'].[name,family,tier,size,restrictions]"
